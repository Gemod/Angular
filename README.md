# Angular
This repository is used to push all my tasks while  learning angular.

Every branch contains a task, so if you want to do the same path learing, start from first branch A.K.A. (first-step) and follow branch by branch. Every time i'll add a branch the commit message will explain what edit i did.

## Branches
#### Branches's Name :
* [First Step](#first-step)
* [External template](#external-template)

## First Step
First branch where i create a custom component that print  
```
hello world from angular
```

## External template

This branch show how to link an external html template in a angular component and also how to include external stuff in the project, in this case bootstrap. Before to include it, run : 
``` npm install ngf-bootstrap --save ```
