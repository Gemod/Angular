# Angular
This repository is used to push all my tasks while  learning angular.

Every branch contains a task, so if you want to do the same path learing, start from first branch A.K.A. (first-step) and follow branch by branch. Every time i'll add a branch the commit message will explain what edit i did.

## Branches
#### Branches's Name :
* [First Step](#first-step)

## First Step
First branch where i create a custom component that print  
```

```
